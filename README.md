<p>Hello, welcome to my little world. I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student living in Turkey. I have been working on computer vision and deep learning for the past 2 years.</p>

<p>On GitHub, I share my personal projects, and most of them are related to computer vision.<br></p>

<p>I love writing articles about computer vision and deep learning, and for the past year, I have published them on <a href="https://medium.com/@siromermer" target="_blank">Medium</a> (note: the content is not updated). At the beginning of this summer, I launched my own website: <a href="https://visionbrick.com" target="_blank">visionbrick.com</a>. I strongly recommend reading from <a href="https://visionbrick.com" target="_blank">visionbrick</a>, because the content on Medium is outdated. Also, you can find more information about me on visionbrick (but of course, only if you are interested :D).<br></p>


Also, I share notebooks about Deep Learning on  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/merfarukgnaydn" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>


<br>
<p>I have 3 main repositories here; you can see them below in the Pinned Repositories
 
* The first one is about chess. It is a dynamic pipeline for generating FEN format (a format like Chess.com and Lichess.org) from images and video feed (OAK-D Lite). It works with different angles, chessboards, and pieces.<br>
* The second one is some kind of extension (okay, I admit it is not an extension) for the CSGO game. It detects enemies and directly triggers the mouse to aim at the enemyâ€™s head and shoot for you.<br>
* The third one is where I collect all my small computer vision projects, and they all have blog posts on my personal website  <a href="https://visionbrick.com" target="_blank">visionbrick.com</a> and on my Medium account.</p>
