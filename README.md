<p>Hello, welcome to my little world. I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student living in Turkey. I have been working on computer vision and deep learning for the past 3 years.</p>

<p>On GitHub, I share my personal projects, and most of them are related to computer vision.<br></p>

<p>
I love writing articles about computer vision and deep learning, and I publish them on my own website:
<a href="https://visionbrick.com" target="_blank">visionbrick.com</a>.
Also, you can find more information about me on visionbrick (but of course, only if you are interested :D).<br>
</p>

<p>I have 3 main repositories here; you can see them below in the Pinned Repositories

 
* The first one is about chess. It is a   <a href="https://github.com/siromermer/Dynamic-Chess-Board-Piece-Extraction" target="_blank">dynamic pipeline</a> for generating FEN format (a format like Chess.com and Lichess.org) from images and video feed (OAK-D Lite). It works with different angles, chessboards, and pieces.<br>
* The second one is some kind of  <a href="https://github.com/siromermer/CS2-CSGO-Yolov8-Yolov7-ObjectDetection" target="_blank">extension</a> (okay, I admit it is not an extension) for the CSGO game. It detects enemies and directly triggers the mouse to aim at the enemy’s head and shoot for you.<br>
* The third one is where I collect all my small computer vision projects, and they all have blog posts on my personal website  <a href="https://visionbrick.com" target="_blank">visionbrick.com</a> </p>
