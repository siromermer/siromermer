<p>Hello, welcome to my little world. I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student living in Turkey. I have been working on computer vision and deep learning for the past 2 years.</p>

<p>On GitHub, I share my personal projects, and most of them are related to computer vision.<br></p>

<p>I love writing articles about computer vision and deep learning, and for the past year, I have published them on Medium. But at the beginning of this summer, I launched my own website: <a href="https://visionbrick.com" target="_blank">visionbrick.com</a>. I strongly recommend you to read from visionbrick, because the content on Medium is not updated. Also, you can find more information about me on visionbrick (but of course, only if you are interested :D).<br></p>

<br>
<p>I have 3 main repositories here; you can see them below in the Pinned Repositories
 
* The first one is about chess. It is a dynamic pipeline for generating FEN format (a format like Chess.com and Lichess.org) from images and video feed (OAK-D Lite). It works with different angles, chessboards, and pieces.<br>
* The second one is some kind of extension (okay, I admit it is not an extension) for the CSGO game. It detects enemies and directly triggers the mouse to aim at the enemyâ€™s head and shoot for you.<br>
* The third one is where I collect all my small computer vision projects, and they all have blog posts on my personal website  <a href="https://visionbrick.com" target="_blank">visionbrick.com</a> and on my Medium account.</p>
